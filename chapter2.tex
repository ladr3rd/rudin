\begin{questions}
  \question Prove that the empty set is a subset of every set.
  \begin{solution}
    Let $A$ be a set. The implication $x\in\emptyset\implies x\in A$ holds because $x\in\emptyset$ is never true, hence $\emptyset\subset A$.
  \end{solution}

  \question A complex number $z$ is said to be \emph{algebraic} if there are integers $a_0,\ldots,a_n$, not all zero, such that
  \[ a_0z^n + a_1z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1}z + a_n = 0. \]
  Prove that the set of all algebraic numbers is countable. \emph{Hint:} For every positive integer $N$ there are only finitely many equations with
  \[ n + \abs{a_0} + \abs{a_1} + \cdots \abs{a_n} = N. \]
  \begin{solution}
    Let $A_N$ denote the set of all complex numbers $z$ such that there exist integers $a_0,\ldots,a_n$ not all zero, such that $n+\abs{a_0}+\abs{a_1}+\cdots+\abs{a_n}=N$ and
    \[ a_0z^n + a_1z^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1}z + a_n = 0. \]
    Then for each $N\in\N$, $A_N$ is finite, as from the hint there are only finitely many equations with $n+\abs{a_0}+\abs{a_1}+\cdots+\abs{a_n}=N$, and each of these equations has finitely many solutions.

    It is clear that $\bigcup_{N\in\N} A_N$ is the set of all algebraic numbers. Being a countable union of at most countable sets, it is at most countable. Every natural number $n$ is an algebraic number, being a solution to $z-n=0$, so the set of all algebraic numbers is infinite and hence countable.
  \end{solution}

  \question Prove that there exist real numbers which are not algebraic.
  \begin{solution}
    The set of real numbers is uncountable. The set of complex algebraic numbers is countable by the previous exercise, hence the set of real algebraic numbers is at most countable. Hence the set of real numbers cannot equal the set of real algebraic numbers, so there exist real numbers which are not algebraic.
  \end{solution}

  \question Is the set of all irrational real numbers countable?
  \begin{solution}
    If the set $\R\setminus\Q$ were countable, then as $\Q$ is countable, $\R=\Q\cup(\R\setminus\Q)$ would be an at most countable union of countable sets, hence $\R$ would be countable. We know that $\R$ is uncountable, so $\R\setminus\Q$ must also be uncountable.
  \end{solution}

  \question Construct a bounded set of real numbers with exactly three limit points.

  \question Let $E'$ be the set of all limit points of a set $E$. Prove that $E'$ is closed. Prove that $E$ and $\cl{E}$ have the same limit points. (Recall that $\cl{E}=E\cup E'$.) Do $E$ and $E'$ always have the same limit points?

  \question Let $A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots$ be subsets of a metric space.
  \begin{parts}
    \part If $B_n=\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i$, prove that $\cl{B_n}=\bigcup_{i=1}^n\cl{A_i}$, for $n=1,2,3,$ \ldots.

    \part If $B=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$, prove that $\cl{B}\supset\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty\cl{A_i}$. Show, by an example, that this inclusion can be proper.
  \end{parts}

  \question Is every point of every open set $E\subset\R^2$ a limit point of $E$? Answer the same question for closed sets in $\R^2$.

  \question Let $\interior{E}$ denote the set of all interior points of a set $E$. [See Definition 2.18(e); $\interior{E}$ is called the \emph{interior} of $E$.]
  \begin{parts}
    \part Prove that $\interior{E}$ is always open.

    \part Prove that $E$ is open if and only if $\interior{E}=E$.

    \part If $G\subset E$ and $G$ is open, prove that $G\subset\interior{E}$.

    \part Prove that the complement of $\interior{E}$ is the closure of the complement of $E$.

    \part Do $E$ and $\cl{E}$ always have the same interiors?

    \part Do $E$ and $\interior{E}$ always have the same closures?
  \end{parts}

  \question Let $X$ be an infinite set. For $p\in X$ and $q\in X$, define
  \[ d(p,q) =
    \begin{cases}
      1 & \text{(if $p\neq q$)} \\
      0 & \text{(if $p=q$).}
    \end{cases}
  \]
  Prove that this is a metric. Which subsets of the resulting metric space are open? Which are closed? Which are compact?

  \question For $x\in\R^1$ and $y\in\R^1$, define
  \begin{align*}
    d_1(x,y) &= (x-y)^2, \\
    d_2(x,y) &= \sqrt{\abs{x-y}}, \\
    d_3(x,y) &= \abs{x^2-y^2}, \\
    d_4(x,y) &= \abs{x-2y}, \\
    d_5(x,y) &= \frac{\abs{x-y}}{1+\abs{x-y}}.
  \end{align*}
  Determine, for each of these, whether it is a metric or not.

  \question Let $K\subset\R^1$ consist of 0 and the numbers $1/n$, for $n=1,2,3,$ \ldots. Prove that $K$ is compact directly from the definition (without using the Heine-Borel theorem).

  \question Construct a compact set of real numbers whose limit points for a countable set.

  \question Give an example of an open cover of the segment $(0,1)$ which has no finite subcover.

  \question Show that Theorem 2.36 and its Corollary become false (in $R^1$, for example) if the word ``compact'' is replaced by ``closed'' or by ``bounded.''

  \question Regard $\Q$, the set of all rational numbers, as a metric space, with $d(p,q)=\abs{p-q}$. Let $E$ be the set of all $p\in\Q$ such that $2<p^2<3$. Show that $E$ is closed and bounded in $\Q$, but that $E$ is not compact. Is $E$ open in $\Q$?

  \question Let $E$ be the set of all $x\in[0,1]$ whose decimal expansion contains only the digits 4 and 7. Is $E$ countable? Is $E$ dense in $[0,1]$? Is $E$ compact? Is $E$ perfect?

  \question Is there a nonempty perfect set in $\R^1$ which contains no rational number?

  \question
  \begin{parts}
    \part If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint closed sets in some metric space $X$, prove that they are separated.

    \part Prove the same for disjoint open sets.

    \part Fix $p\in X$, $\delta>0$, define $A$ to be the set of all $q\in X$ for which $d(p,q)<\delta$, define $B$ similarly, with $>$ in place of $<$. Prove that $A$ and $B$ are separated.

    \part Prove that every connected metric space with at least two points is uncountable. \emph{Hint:} Use (c).
  \end{parts}

  \question Are closures and interiors of connected sets always connected? (Look at subset of $\R^2$.)

  \question Let $A$ and $B$ be separated subsets of some $\R^k$, suppose $\vec{a}\in A$, $\vec{b}\in B$, and define
  \[ \vec{p}(t) = (1-t)\vec{a} + t\vec{b} \]
  for $t\in\R^1$. Put $A_0=\vec{p}^{-1}(A)$, $B_0=\vec{p}^{-1}(B)$. [Thus $t\in A_0$ if and only if $\vec{p}(t)\in A$.]
  \begin{parts}
    \part Prove that $A_0$ and $B_0$ are separated subsets of $\R^1$.

    \part Prove that there exists $t_0\in(0,1)$ such that $\vec{p}(t_0)\notin A\cup B$.

    \part Prove that every convex subset of $\R^k$ is connected.
  \end{parts}

  \question A metric space is called separable if it contains a countable dense subset. Show that $\R^k$ is separable. \emph{Hint:} Consider the set of points which have only rational coordinates.

  \question A collection $\{V_\alpha\}$ of open subsets of $X$ is said to be a \emph{base} for $X$ if the following is true: For every $x\in X$ and every open set $G\subset X$ such that $x\in G$, we have $x\in V_\alpha\subset G$ for some $\alpha$. In other words, every open set in $X$ is the union of a subcollection of $\{V_\alpha\}$.

  Prove that every separable metric space has a \emph{countable} base. \emph{Hint:} Take all neighbourhoods with rational radius and center in some countable dense subset of $X$.

  \question Let $X$ be a metric space in which every infinite subset has a limit point. Prove that $X$ is separable. \emph{Hint:} Fix $\delta>0$, and pick $x_1\in X$. Having chosen $x_1,\ldots,x_j\in X$, choose $x_{j+1}\in X$, if possible, so that $d(x_1,x_{j+1})\geq\delta$ for $i=1,\ldots,j$. Show that this process must stop after a finite number of steps, and that $X$ can therefore be covered by finitely many neighbourhoods of radius $\delta$. Take $\delta=1/n$ ($n=1,2,3,\ldots$), and consider the centers of the corresponding neighbourhoods.

  \question Prove that every compact metric space $K$ has a countable base, and that $K$ is therefore separable. \emph{Hint:} For every positive integer $n$ there are finitely many neighbourhoods of radius $1/n$ whose union covers $K$.

  \question Let $X$ be a metric space in which every infinite subset has a limit point. Prove that $X$ is compact. \emph{Hint:} By Exercises 23 and 24, $X$ has a countable base. It follows that every open cover of $X$ has a \emph{countable} subcover $\{G_n\}$, $n=1,2,3,$ \ldots. If no finite subcollection of $\{G_n\}$ covers $X$, then the complement $F_n$ of $G_1\cup\cdots\cup G_n$ is nonempty for each $n$, but $\bigcap F_n$ is empty. If $E$ is a set which contains a point from each $F_n$, consider a limit point of $E$, and obtain a contradiction.

  \question Define a point $p$ in a metric space $X$ to be a \emph{condensation point} of a set $E\subset X$ if every neighbourhood of $p$ contains uncountably many points of $E$.

  Suppose $E\subset\R^k$, $E$ is uncountable, and let $P$ be the set of all condensation points of $E$. Prove that $P$ is perfect and that at most countably many points of $E$ are not in $P$. In other words, show that $P^c\cap E$ is at most countable. \emph{Hint:} Let $\{V_n\}$ be a countable base of $\R^k$, let $W$ be the union of those $V_n$ for which $E\cap V_n$ is at most countable, and show that $P=W^c$.

  \question Prove that every closed set in a separable metric space is the union of a (possibly empty) perfect set and a set which is at most countable (\emph{Corollary:} Every countable closed set in $\R^k$ has isolated points.) \emph{Hint:} Use Exercise 27.

  \question Prove that every open set in $\R^1$ is the union of an at most countable collection of disjoint segments. \emph{Hint:} Use Exercise 22.

  \question Imitate the proof of Theorem 2.43 to obtain the following result:

  If $\R^k=\bigcup_1^\infty F_n$, where each $F_n$ is a closed subset of $\R^k$, then at least one $F_n$ has a nonempty interior.

  \emph{Equivalent statement:} If $G_n$ is a dense open subset of $\R^k$, for $n=1,2,3,$ \ldots, then $\bigcap_1^\infty G_n$ is not empty (in fact, it is dense in $\R^k$).

  (This is a special case of Baire's theorem; see Exercise 22, Chap. 3, for the general case.)
