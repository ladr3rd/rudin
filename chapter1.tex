\section{The Real and Complex Number Systems}

Unless the contrary is explicitly stated, all numbers that are mentioned in these exercises are understood to be real.

\begin{questions}
  \question If $r$ is rational ($r\neq0$) and $x$ is irrational, prove that $r+x$ and $rx$ are irrational.
  \begin{solution}
    If $r+x$ were rational, then so too would be $(-r)+(r+x)=x$. If $rx$ were rational, then since $r\neq0$, $(1/r)\cdot(rx)=x$ would also be rational.

    As $x$ is irrational, it follows that $r+x$ and $rx$ are irrational too.
  \end{solution}

  \question Prove that there is no rational number whose square is 12.
  \begin{solution}
    Suppose there was a rational $r$ satisfying $r^2=12$. Then we may write $r=m/n$ where $m$ and $n$ are integers that are not both multiples of 3. The integers $m,n$ satisfy
    \[ m^2 = 12n^2.. \]
    Hence $m^2$ is a multiple of 3. Since 3 is prime it follows that $m$ is a multiple of 3. Similarly we may deduce that $m$ is a multiple of 2. Hence $m$ is a multiple of 6, so we may write $m=6k$ where $k$ is an integer. This yields
    \[ 36k^2 = 12n^2 \implies 3k^2 = n^2. \]
    Then $n^2$ is a multiple of 3, so that $n$ is a multiple of 3. This contradicts our choice of $m$ and $n$. Hence can be no rational number whose square is 12.
  \end{solution}

  \question Prove Proposition 1.15: The axioms for multiplication imply the following statements.
  \begin{parts}
    \part If $x\neq0$ and $xy=xz$ then $y=z$.

    \part If $x\neq0$ and $xy=x$ then $y=1$.

    \part If $x\neq0$ and $xy=1$ then $y=1/x$.

    \part If $x\neq0$ then $1/(1/x)=x$.
  \end{parts}
  \begin{solution}
    If $x\neq0$ and $xy=xz$, the axioms for multiplication give
    \begin{align*}
      y = 1\cdot y &= \left( \frac{1}{x}\cdot x \right)y = \frac{1}{x}\cdot(xy) \\
                   &= \frac{1}{x}\cdot(xz) = \left(\frac{1}{x}\cdot x\right)z = 1\cdot z = z.
    \end{align*}
    This proves (a). Take $z=1$ in (a) to obtain (b). Take $z=1/x$ in (a) to obtain (c). Since $(1/x)\cdot x=1$, (c) (with $1/x$ in place of $x$, and $x$ in place of $y$) gives (d).
  \end{solution}

  \question Let $E$ be a nonempty subset of an ordered set; suppose $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$ and $\beta$ is an upper bound of $E$. Prove that $\alpha\leq\beta$.
  \begin{solution}
    Let $x\in E$, then $\alpha \leq x$, since $\alpha$ is a lower bound of $E$, and $x\leq \beta$, since $\beta$ is an upper bound of $E$. If $\alpha=x$ then from $x\leq\beta$ we see $\alpha\leq\beta$. Similarly if $x=\beta$ then from $\alpha\leq x$ we see $\alpha\leq\beta$.

    If neither $\alpha=x$ nor $x=\beta$ hold, then $\alpha<x$ and $x<\beta$, in which case it follows from the definition of an ordered set that $\alpha<\beta$. Hence in all cases, $\alpha\leq\beta$.
  \end{solution}

  \question Let $A$ be a nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded below. Let $-A$ be the set of all numbers $-x$, where $x\in A$. Prove that
  \[ \inf A = -\sup(-A). \]
  \begin{solution}
    Let $x\in A$, then $-x\in-A$, hence
    \[ -x \leq \sup(-A) \implies -\sup(-A) \leq x. \]
    Therefore $-\sup(-A)$ is a lower bound of $A$. Let $\alpha>-\sup(-A)$, then $-\alpha<\sup(-A)$. Hence $-\alpha$ is not an upper bound of $-A$. All elements of $-A$ have the form $-x$ for some $x\in A$, so there exists some $x\in A$ for which
    \[ -\alpha < -x \implies x < \alpha. \]
    Therefore $\alpha$ is not a lower bound of $A$. It follows that
    \[ \inf A = -\sup(-A). \]
  \end{solution}

  \question Fix $b>1$.
  \begin{parts}
    \part If $m$, $n$, $p$, $q$ are integers, $n>0$, $q>0$, and $r=m/n=p/q$, prove that
    \[ (b^m)^{1/n} = (b^p)^{1/q}. \]
    Hence it makes sense to define $b^r=(b^m)^{1/n}$.
    \begin{solution}
      Let $y=(b^m)^{1/n}$ be the unique positive $n$th root of $b^m$. Then $y^n=b^m$, hence $y^{nq}=b^{mq}$. Since $m/n=p/q$, $mq=np$, therefore $b^{mq}=b^{np}$. It follows that $y^q$ and $b^p$ are both positive $n$th roots of the common number $y^{nq}=b^{np}$. As positive $n$th roots are unique, $y^q=b^p$, and so $y=(b^p)^{1/q}$.
    \end{solution}

    \part Prove that $b^{r+s}=b^rb^s$ is $r$ and $s$ are rational.
    \begin{solution}
      Write $r$ and $s$ with a common positive denominator $d>0$, say $r=m/d$ and $s=n/d$, where $m$, $n$, and $d$ are all integers. Then
      \begin{align*}
        (b^rb^s)^d &= ((b^m)^{1/d}\cdot(b^n)^{1/d})^d \\
                   &= ((b^m)^{1/d})^d\cdot((b^{n})^{1/d})^d = b^mb^n = b^{m+n}.
      \end{align*}
      Therefore $b^rb^s$ is the unique positive $d$th root of $b^{m+n}$, hence
      \[ b^rb^s = (b^{m+n})^{1/d} = b^{(m+n)/d} = b^{r+s}. \]
    \end{solution}

    \part If $x$ is real, define $B(x)$ to be the set of all numbers $b^t$, where $t$ is rational and $t\leq x$. Prove that
    \[ b^r = \sup B(r) \]
    when $r$ is rational. Hence it makes sense to define
    \[ b^x = \sup B(x) \]
    for every real $x$.
    \begin{solution}
      It suffices to show that $b^t\leq b^r$ for every rational $t\leq r$. Then $b^r$ will be an upper bound of $B(r)$, while also being an element of it, so it will follow that it is the least upper bound of $B(r)$.

      Let $r,t$ be rationals with $t\leq r$. Write them with a common positive denominator $d>0$, say $r=m/d$ and $t=n/d$, where $m$, $n$, and $d$ are all integers. Then $m\geq n$, so $m-n\geq0$. An easy induction will verify that $b^{m-n}\geq1$ for any nonnegative integer value of $m-n$. Therefore
      \[ b^m=b^n\cdot b^{m-n}\geq b^n. \]
      Suppose for a contradiction that $b^t>b^r$, i.e. $(b^n)^{1/d}>(b^m)^{1/d}$. It follows by induction that
      \[ ((b^n)^{1/d})^d>((b^m)^{1/d})^d \implies b^n > b^m, \]
      which is a contradiction. Hence $b^t\leq b^r$, and so the result follows.
    \end{solution}

    \part Prove that $b^{x+y}=b^xb^y$ for all real $x$ and $y$.
  \end{parts}

  \question Fix $b>1$, $y>0$, and prove that there is a unique real $x$ such that $b^x=y$, by completing the following outline. (This is called the logarithm of $y$ to the base $b$.)
  \begin{parts}
    \part For any positive integer $n$, $b^n-1\geq n(b-1)$.
    \begin{solution}
      The result is clear when $n=1$. Suppose the result holds for some positive integer $n$, then since $b^n>1$ we have
      \begin{align*}
        b^{n+1}-1  &= b^n(b-1) + (b^n-1) \\
                   &> (b-1)+n(b-1) \\
                   &= (n+1)(b-1).
      \end{align*}
      By induction it follows that $b^n-1\geq n(b-1)$ for all positive integers $n$.
    \end{solution}

    \part Hence $b-1\geq n(b^{1/n}-1)$.
    \begin{solution}
      Apply part (a) with $b^{1/n}$ in place of $b$.
    \end{solution}

    \part If $t>1$ and $n>(b-1)/(t-1)$, then $b^{1/n}<t$.
    \begin{solution}
      Since $t-1>0$, multiplying both sides of $n>(b-1)/(t-1)$ by $t-1$, and applying (b) yields
      \[ n(t-1) > (b-1) \geq n(b^{1/n}-1) \implies t-1 > b^{1/n} - 1. \]
      Hence $b^{1/n}<t$.
    \end{solution}

    \part If $w$ is such that $b^w<y$, then $b^{w+(1/n)}<y$ for sufficiently large $n$; to see this, apply part (c) with $t=y\cdot b^{-w}$.
    \begin{solution}
      By the archimedian property of $\R$, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that
      \[ N(y-b^w) > b^w(b-1) \implies N > \frac{b-1}{y\cdot b^{-w} - 1}. \]
      Then for all $n\geq N$, if we let $t=y\cdot b^{-w}$ then $n>(b-1)/(t-1)$, so by (c)
      \[ b^{1/n} < y\cdot b^{-w} \implies b^{w+(1/n)} = b^{1/n}b^w < y. \]
    \end{solution}

    \part If $b^w>y$, then $b^{w-(1/n)}>y$ for sufficiently large $n$.
    \begin{solution}
      We have $b^{-w}<y^{-1}$, so  from the previous part, $b^{-w+(1/n)}<y^{-1}$ for sufficiently large $n$. Hence $b^{w-(1/n)}>y$ for sufficiently large $n$.
    \end{solution}

    \part Let $A$ be the set of all $w$ such that $b^w<y$, and show that $x=\sup A$ satisfies $b^x=y$.
    \begin{solution}
      Suppose $b^x<y$. By (d) there is a positive $n$ such that $b^{x+(1/n)}<y$, so that $x+(1/n)\in A$, which contradicts $x$ being an upper bound of $A$.

      Suppose $b^x>y$. By (e) there is a positive $n$ with $b^{x-(1/n)}>y$, so that $b^{x-(1/n)}>b^w$ for all $w\in A$. Therefore $b^w$ is not an upper bound of $B(x-(1/n))$, for all $w\in A$. So for all $w\in A$ there is a $t\in \Q$ with $t\leq x-(1/n)$ such that
      \[ b^t > b^w \implies t > w. \]

      By the density of $\Q$ in $\R$ it follows that
      \[ x-(1/n)=\sup\{t\in\Q \mid t\leq x-(1/n)\}. \]
      Therefore $x-(1/n)\geq w$ for all $w\in A$, hence $x-(1/n)$ is an upper bound of $A$. This contradicts $x$ being the least upper bound of $A$. The only possibility which remains is $b^x=y$.
    \end{solution}

    \part Prove that this $x$ is unique.
    \begin{solution}
      If $x>z$, then there exists a $t\in\Q$ with $0<t<x-z$, so that $b^t<b^{x-z}$. Since $t>0$ then $b^t>b^0=1$, hence
      \[ b^x = b^{x-z}b^z > b^tb^z > b^z. \]
      Similarly if $x<z$ then $b^x<b^z$. So if $b^x=y=b^z$ we must have $x=z$.
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

  \question Prove that no order can be defined in the complex field that turns it into an ordered field. \emph{Hint:} $-1$ is a square.

  \question Suppose $z=a+bi$, $w=c+di$. Define $z<w$ if $a<c$, and also if $a=c$ but $b<d$. Prove that this turns the set of all complex numbers into an ordered set. (This type of order relation is called a \emph{dictionary order}, or \emph{lexicographic order}, for obvious reasons.) Does this ordered set have the least-upper-bound property?

  \question Suppose $z=a+bi$, $w=u+iv$, and
  \[ a = \left( \frac{\abs{w} + u}{2} \right)^{1/2}, \qquad b = \left( \frac{\abs{w} - u}{2} \right)^{1/2}. \]
  Prove that $z^2=w$ if $v\geq0$ and that $(\conj{z})^2$ if $v\leq0$. Conclude that every complex number (with one exception!) has two complex square roots.

  \question If $z$ is a complex number, prove that there exists an $r\geq0$ and a complex number $w$ with $\abs{w}=1$ such that $z=rw$. Are $w$ and $r$ always uniquely determined by $z$?

  \question If $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ are complex, prove that
  \[ \abs{z_1+z_2+\cdots+z_n} \leq \abs{z_1}+\abs{z_2}+\cdots+\abs{z_n}. \]

  \question If $x,y$ are complex, prove that
  \[ \abs{\abs{x} - \abs{y}} \leq \abs{x-y}. \]

  \question If $z$ is a complex number such that $\abs{z}=1$, that is, such that $z\conj{z}=1$, compute
  \[ \abs{1+z}^2 + \abs{1-z}^2. \]

  \question Under what conditions does equality hold in the Schwarz inequality?

  \question Suppose $k\geq3$, $\vect{x}, \vect{y}\in\R^k$, $\abs{\vect{x}-\vect{y}}=d>0$, and $r>0$. Prove:
  \begin{parts}
    \part If $2r>d$, there are infinitely many $\vect{z}\in\R^k$ such that
    \[ \abs{\vect{z} - \vect{x}} = \abs{\vect{z} - \vect{y}} = r. \]

    \part If $2r=d$, there is exactly one such $\vect{z}$.

    \part If $2r<d$, there is no such $\vect{z}$.
  \end{parts}
  How must these statements be modified if $k$ is 2 or 1?

  \question Prove that
  \[ \abs{\vect{x} + \vect{y}}^2 + \abs{\vect{x} - \vect{y}}^2 = 2\abs{\vect{x}}^2 + 2\abs{\vect{y}}^2 \]
  if $\vect{x}\in\R^k$ and $\vect{y}\in\R^k$. Interpret this geometrically, as a statement about parallelograms.

  \question If $k\geq2$ and $\vect{x}\in\R^k$, prove that there exists $\vect{y}\in\R^k$ such that $\vect{y}\neq\vect{0}$ but $\vect{x}\cdot\vect{y}=0$. Is this also true if $k=1$?

  \question Suppose $\vect{a}\in\R^k$, $\vect{b}\in\R^k$. Find $\vect{c}\in\R^k$ and $r>0$ such that
  \[ \abs{\vect{x}-\vect{a}} = 2\abs{\vect{x}-\vect{b}} \]
  if and only if $\abs{\vect{x}-\vect{c}}=r$.
  (\emph{Solution:} $3\vect{c}=4\vect{b}-\vect{a}$, $3r=2\abs{\vect{b}-\vect{a}}$.)

  \question With reference to the Appendix, suppose that property (III) were omitted from the definition of a cut. Keep the same definitions of order and addition. Show that the resulting ordered set has the least-upper-bound property, that addition satisfies the axioms (A1) to (A4) (with a slightly different zero-element!) but that (A5) fails.
